# csv-to-json
Converting CSV files to JSON objects (linked to my tube-line-data repo)

This was made so I could convert the csv files that I made in the tube-line-data repo into their own JSON objects so that they can be loaded onto databases.

The script works by inputting a file path when running the script as the other argument and then outputs to the data.json file
